## Action Script

Action script is the built-in Energize scripting language. It doesn't really have a name; we just call it action script because it is used primarily for coding request route actions. Action script is not at all to be confused with [ActionScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript) and has not at all been influence by that language. In the future, once we have thought of an actual name for the language, we may stop calling it action script.
