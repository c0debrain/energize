## Automated

Simply define your resource using the basic [Action Script](/energize/docs/action-script) syntax, and Energize will handle the rest. From creating the database, to generating all the routes and CRUD operations, every layer is automated.

## Flexible

It's easy to write your own CRUD operations, and also have your own routes that execute custom action code. Energize automates everything for you, but some things require special server side code that isn't quite boilerplate.

## Secured

Energize implements both Basic Auth and Bearer Token Auth across your API for you. Users are built-in with the customizable `users` resource, which allows you to secure your resources and manage access control in seconds.
