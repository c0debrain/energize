## Automated

Simply define your resource using the basic [Energize Scripting Language](/energize/docs/action-script), and Energize will handle the rest for you. From creating the relational database, to generating all the routes and CRUD operations, every layer is automated.

## Flexible

Energize automates a lot for you, but it's also designed to be flexible enough for a wide range of requirements. That is why it's easy to override prebuilt resource endpoints with your own code, since Energize allows you to choose between JavaScript or ESL (Energize Scripting Language) for executing server-side code.

## Secured

Energize implements both Basic Authentication and Bearer Token Authentication across your API for you. Users are built-in with the customizable `users` resource, which allows you to secure your resources and manage access control in seconds.
