## Production Ready

Use Energize to build a mock API in seconds. Your mock is also production ready, so let your users consume your API right away. Every feature you would need your API to have is baked-in and optimized.

## Database Generation

Without having to write a single line of SQL, your database schema, tables, and queries are automatically constructed from your API design. Never worry about learning another database management system again. 

## Endpoints

Simply define a resource and let Energize generate all the CRUD endpoints for you. It will also create routes to handle common features like filters, pagination, fields, etc.
